1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Videos with subtitles get much more engagement than videos without

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,100
subtitles. In a recent study, 92% of videos viewed on mobile were viewed

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,400
without sound.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,500
So whether you love them or hate them, there's no denying subtitles

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,700
and captioned text will help your videos perform better. In this video,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,200
you'll learn how to easily add subtitles to any video and we'll do that

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
right now.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Hey, what's up y'all?

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,400
This is Brian White and welcome back to VideoZeus. On this channel

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,800
we produce weekly content for creators, educators and marketers, all in

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,700
an effort to help you spend less time making more videos.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,400
So if that sounds like the kind of stuff

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
you're into, consider clicking the subscribe button now.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,400
So today I'm going to show you a quick, easy and free way to add

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,500
subtitles to any video. We'll be using an online video editing

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,500
application called Kapwing. Now aside from being a great video

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,600
creation platform, Kapwing also has a lot of really useful tools with

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,000
one of them being the auto subtitle tool. This works for any video.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,800
You can sign up for a free Kapwing account by following the link in the

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,400
description below.

21
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,700
Now, once inside your Kapwing workspace, we can access the subtitler

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,100
by clicking this button in this menu on the left. Alright next, on this

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,000
page we'll upload our video file by clicking in here or we can simply

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
paste a link from an existing online video.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,100
Like a YouTube link. Now

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,400
we're inside the subtitler tool.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,500
You'll see your video preview, some text options,

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,700
but first, let's focus our attention into the add subtitles area over

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,900
here. Next simply click on the auto generate button.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,400
And then on this screen select the native language featured in your

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,800
video and if needed you can select to transcribe the video into

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
subtitles for another language.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,300
We'll just keep it on English for now and click on auto generate. Kapwing

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,000
will process your video, extract the audio and transcribe it. Once that

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,700
process is finished.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,900
You'll now see the subtitles displayed on screen.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Let's go ahead and click on his play button to play back this short

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,400
video to see how well the AI did at transcribing the audio and if any

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,500
edits need to be made.

40
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,900
Shhhh...

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,100
I'll let you in on a little secret. Subtitled videos perform way better

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,900
than videos without subtitles.

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,700
In fact, Facebook shows that 85% of the videos viewed on the platform

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
are viewed without sound. So subtitles make your content easily consumable

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,100
by audiences because they longer have to click inside the video to

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,500
hear it.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
They can actually see it taking place on the screen through the subtitled text.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, actually not too bad. If I have spoken a little more clearly the

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,300
results would have been better.

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,100
So remember that for when you try it. But not to worry, we can easily

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,300
edit the text and the timing of these subtitles. You'll simply listen,

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,600
review and edit your subtitles... exactly like you'd edit a Word document.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,000
If you need to add a subtitle, you can click down here on add

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,700
subtitle, add your new text and use these time stamps to properly time

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,400
out when your new subtitle begins and ends. Certainly to remove or

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
duplicate a subtitle, simply click on one of these buttons.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,500
So now that we have these subtitles customized to our liking we can

58
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,600
play it back to review.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
Shhhh...

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,500
"I'll let you in on a little secret. Subtitled videos perform way better

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,400
than videos without subtitles. In fact, Facebook shows that 85% of the

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,600
videos viewed on the platform are viewed without sound" Now that we

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,600
have our subtitles properly edited and timed out, we can focus our

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,700
attention to the text options panel to stylize our new subtitles.

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,900
There are plenty of options to choose from to customize your subtitles.

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,400
But at the end of the day just make sure it's readable. Next will click

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,700
down here on the done button, which will take us into the Kapwing studio where

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,900
we can perform further editing tasks such as trimming the clip and

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,500
adding graphics to name a few, but for now, we're just going to click

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,200
up here on export video. Kapwing will process your editing request and

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,100
take you to this page where you can download your video file, copy a

72
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,700
link to share it or jump back into edit it.

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,200
Definitely check out Kapwing with the link in the description below.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,700
So you can also add subtitles to any video in just minutes.

75
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,200
 Consider watching this video next to learn how to

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,200
use the Kapwing to remove the background of any video without a green screen.

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,799
Once again, thanks for watching VideoZeus.

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Helping you spend less time making more videos.
