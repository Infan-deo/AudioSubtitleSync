00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh-oh-oh

2
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Hit me like a shot in the heart

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,100
Never shoulda played you so hard

4
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,600
Guess I played myself, that's my fault

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,500
Mmm-mm-mm

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,100
I don't even know how to think

7
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,600
'Cause now she got your
heart so I feel

8
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,800
Stupid, foolish

9
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,700
'Fraid I'm losing everything

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,900
I thought I couldn't

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
My whole world is falling apart

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,850
Don't you go falling in love

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,200
Trust me she's not the one

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,700
She won't ever

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,700
Love you like I do

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,550
Hold you like I do, know you like I do

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Don't you go fallin' in love

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,300
Touch you like I do, nothing like I do

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Nothing like I do

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,100
Hit me like a poisonous dart

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
You wеre trouble right from the start

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,700
